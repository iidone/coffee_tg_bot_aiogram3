This is a telegram bot on aiogram3, which allows the user to book a table in a coffee shop by entering the name, phone number, date and time of the reservation, and there is also an option to write whether the user has any allergies. You can also add your comment. The bot was created for the coffee shop website on Django (there is a QR code to go to this bot). You can see the repository of the site in my profile.
